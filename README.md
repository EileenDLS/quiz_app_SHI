# quiz_app_SHI
Create an mobile-first, then desktop app, that reads in quiz data from a JSON file and presents the questions one at a time. The quiz will only allow the users to place their answers into a textfield.
Show the correct answers at the end of the quiz and their score.
The promises to build for this applicaton are:
1. Create a promise that will register the user's response into a Set, Map or Array. On success of the promise show a green checkmark. On failure (unable to save the data in 3 seconds), show a red X.
2. Create a promise that will start the quiz after the quiz data is loaded. If the quiz data cannot load, show a error message. The message should use Boostrap Alerts
